category: Components
type: Navigation
title: NavBar
---

Located above the app content area, below the system status bar, and provides navigation capabilities in a series of pages.

### Rules

- You can display the title of the current view in the NavBar. If the title is very lengthy and can not be streamlined, you can be vacant.
- `SegmentedControl` component can be used to hierarchize content in the NavBar.
- Avoid using too many elements to fill the navigation bar. In general, a "return button", a "title", a "current view of the control" is enough; if you already have a SegmentedControl, generally only with a "return button" or "current view of the control."
- For icons and text controls, to provide greater click hotspots.
