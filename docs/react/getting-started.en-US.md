Ant Design React is dedicated to providing a good development experience for programmers.

---

Before delving into Ant Design React, a good knowledge of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) is needed.

### 1. Installation
Make sure that you had installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)(> v4.x) correctly.

### 2. Create a New Project

Copy and modify from [here](https://github.com/ant-design/antd-mobile-samples/tree/master/rn-web).

### 3. Use Components

[See here for details](/docs/react/introduce#Usage).

### 4. Development & Debugging & Building & Deployment

Web and React Native are used in two ways, and are used separately according to the README documentation.

## Customized Work Flow

If you want to customize your work flow, we recommend to use [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to build and debug code.

Also, you can use any [scaffold](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#boilerplates) available in React ecosystem. If you encounter problems, you can use our [webpack config](https://github.com/ant-tool/atool-build/blob/master/src/getWebpackCommonConfig.js) and [modify it](http://ant-tool.github.io/webpack-config.html).

## Tips

- You can use any `npm` modules.
- We recommend to write code in [ES2015](http://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus) as `babel` has been integrated in our work flow.
